So I'm down to these two OBD2 apps, but want to make certain one or both can mod the two I'm most interested in right now: removal of the throttle limitation and throttle response. I've read about both of these, but due to me not knowing their proper names/designations within the code, I'm having a hard time finding support for the apps. Does anyone have any better info/designations for these toggles within our software? I know one might actually be referred to as a "steering assist" or someth.

I have a 2004 prius. I just replaced the inverter pump as it was weak but still working, thinking it would fix these lights. I also did a oil/filter change. They turned off for a bit but then came back on when i got low on fuel (twice it happened when i was low on fuel). I unplugged the 12v and plugged it back in then went and filled up and everything was good until it got low on fuel. Not sure if that's a coincidence. The battery charges and discharges just fine but when it gets these lights. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã –° –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è Carista OBD2 –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —Å–∞–º–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∫—É –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª—è –ø—Ä–∏ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–∏ —Å–º–∞—Ä—Ç—Ñ–æ–Ω–∞ –∏–ª–∏ –ø–ª–∞–Ω—à–µ—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ Android.

I recently purchased the elm327 and torque pro combo, and got it working in my 2014 dart aero. Its a great thing, but I'm not sure what to make of the turbo pressure and manifold vac/pressure readings. They are always showing the same data. Is this unique to my setup, or is someone else seeing it too? I was hoping to see a surging turbo as the reason for the jerky power delivery in cool weather, but all I'm getting is manifold pressure instead. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã.

Hello! I'm trying to decide on which bluetooth OBD2 sensor and app would work best. I've contact a couple of developers and am waiting to hear back but I'm also confused about the different adapters. I am willing to invest some in a good adapter but don't want to spend more needlessly. One of the main things that I'm wanting to do is to be able to clear "maintenance" lights that come up in varying intervals (like for 90k recommended belt changes and more).

Torque is a cutting-edge vehicle diagnostic and performance scanner app for your Android smartphone. The Torque app is a must-have for Bluetooth enabled OBD2 adapters. It's one of my favorite OBDII apps for Android phones. Last weekend I took a trip to visit my girlfriend, and I averaged only 18mpg. I know Subarus are in no way built for fuel economy (hooray for all wheel drive!), but that's substantially below the EPA estimated highway mpg for my car, in fact it's about 50% less. I checked tire pressure and the air filter, as a dirty air filter and low tire pressure can negatively impact mileage, but both were ok.

My 2500HD's gauge cluster went out before I even got it, and I've tried just about everything besides putting a new gauge cluster in, because they are pricey, and I've read horror stories about swapping them out. I actually ran out of gas on the way to the gas station because the fuel gauge doesn't work. Anyway I'm curious if there's a way to bypass the cluster and do a stand alone gauge (even if just for fuel) off the OBD2 plugin.

Hi everyone! I've been meaning to make this post for a while now. I'm hoping to help everyone save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by taking care of their own vehicle. Once upon a time, long ago, this was the way things were done. Even in old owner's manuals from the 1920's they'd often have a paragraph in the beginning telling the owner "If something breaks, it's because you neglected basic care and maintenance!!"

Hey everyone. I have a 18 limited impreza hatchback. I picked up a new obd2 reader, and a copy of torque pro. The problem I am encountering is when I set up my vehicle profile, it asks me for the fuel type.

That's it. I've been googling it, along with a buddy What is Torque? Torque is an OBD2 performance and diagnostic tool for any device that runs the Android operating system.

Going mostly up but today it went down and died twice on me (here's a video of it happening). I thought maybe it was the icp so I bought a Bluetooth obd2 and torque pro app and everything seems normal at idle after being ran for a while here's a screenshot of the stats (https://imgur.com/a/CflNMrs) and here's a short 6 second video (https://youtu.be/LeZjF.

So yesterday the CEL came on but by the time I got home to get a scanner the CEL went off and it didn't come back on even after driving all day today. From Torque Pro I got a P0171 error code for Engine Running Lean though because my car is Pre-OBD2 there's no freeze frame data and limited live data. What measurements I could get after the CEL went off are as follows during idle: RPM: ~700 Water Temperature: 95C Manifold Vacuum: ~26 inHg STFT: -1% - 8% LTFT: 29.7% Revving to about –û—Ç–∑—ã–≤ –≤–ª–∞–¥–µ–ª—å—Ü–∞ KIA Rio (3rd generation) ‚Äî –∞–∫—Å–µ—Å—Å—É–∞—Ä—ã. –¢–µ–º–∫–∞ —É–∂–µ –∑–∞–µ–∑–∂–µ–Ω–∞—è –∏ –≤—Å—ë –∂–µ‚Ä¶ –ü—Ä–∏—à—ë–ª –∏–∑ –ü–æ–¥–Ω–µ–±–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–π –¥–µ–≤–∞–π—Å–∏–∫, SUPER MINI ELM327 Bluetooth OBD2 V1.5 –ú—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π OBD-2.
