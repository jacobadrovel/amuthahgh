The Super Metroid remake will have extra content such as extra boss battles so its not just one single game versus a trilogy. 'Metroid: Samus Returns' isn't the first remake of 'Metroid II.' It's just the first released by Nintendo. And it shows. The Metroid game with the highest chance of being remade next is Super Metroid. What traits, realistically plausable or not, would make this remake "perfect" for you? Personally, I'd want the snappiness of how Samus controls in ZM, Fusion, and AM2R. As a relatively new fan to the series, it takes longer than it should for me to get used to the floatiness of SM. Please ditch the 360° aiming from Samus Returns.
