                            <p> 1. How stable is the experience if using Signal without giving it Contacts permission and without having Google Play Services on Android? Do you reliably receive notifications at all times? How well does the desktop app work? Any problems/quirks? 2. Are people who have my number in contacts notified that I installed/use Signal just as is the case if I give Signal contacts permission? Ie. they will know that I use Signal and will be able to contact me on Signal even if I don't message them first. Credits: Arnova8G2 This port is faster than stock camera app and everything works as intended without any glitch. Portrait mode, enhanced HDR+, Night Sight, Photobooth, Photo Sphere, etc are tested on my 128GB Snapdragon. Try all the different Libs included in this build and you'll love them. Download beta 6 application from the below link, which is the most recent fully working application. DO NOT install beta 8 or 11 apks, because these apks have issues with selfie camera and phone heating. 
I have an unusual tablet running 7.1 without Google Play services or the play store, and I would like to add them. I have installed an older version of services without issue (side-loading off USB). If I then install the Play Store app, and launch, the play store crashes after a moment. Are there any other pieces that I need? Do either of these these to be paired to matching versions I have been struggling with that issue since I started spoofing. I would love to just go and root my phone so that I can use tools that can stop it, but my phone is new and I don't Seems to have activated after a Google Connectivity Services app update, but not sure. Had to close and open Android Messages and then got a welcome screen. amp#x200B; Album Link: ( amp#x200B; Android Messages Version: 3.8.043 (basilisk\_RC21\_xxxhdpi.arm64-v8a.phone) Carrier Services Version: 18.0.219320486-carriersservices\_V18B\_RC03 Google Connectivity Services Version: F.3.0.03 (5154963) Google App Version: 8.65.3. https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/lineageos/ Edit: Title should be apps not roms I can't find a good FOSS dialer, gallery app, and especially a camera. All of them have either a bad UI or lacking features I need. Should I be safe from spyware or tracking if I use these. Hi, without Google framework/services most of the IPTV apps do not work well. Do you know any that do not require it and run well with such Android boxes? Thanks. Few months ago it was so easy to use the wallet. This year I discovered it no longer works. The problem is android phone firmware for Chinese market do not include google play services by default. YOTI app requires google play services to be installed. I hope Richard Ells know this issue and work together with YOTI to fix it. It must be pretty easy for them: buy any XiaoMi smartphone, flash it with Chinese firmware (still can choose English interface), and solve the problem. I've made the mistake of picking up the "smart" controller with my Mavic 2 Pro package from DJI. As it was a combo, I'm hesitant on returning it as it'd be too much of a hassle. I'm looking into buying another controller and was curious whether or not this was compatible with the Mavic 2 Pro: https://m.dji.com/product/mavic-remote-controller?from=searchresults Any help would be appreciated. Hi there, without Google framework/services most of the Live TV apps do not work well or do not work at all after having been sideloaded. Do you know any that do not require it and run well with such Android boxes? Thanks It is great to have a phone that doesn't look like its from 2014 I must say. Battery life for me has been incredible 6 hrs screen on time. No lags. I'm using it in quad hd resolution. No regrets buying it. Albeit it has a slightly worse camera than the Pixel 2, everything else makes it worth it. Just a masterpiece from Samsung. 
I avoid Google Play amp co like the plague. My Pixel 3 XL just got the latest version of the Google App (8.39.6.21 - non beta) and it is constantly showing that the location is being accessed while in the Pixel Launcher. Once I open an app, the location icon will disappear. Return to the launcher, it comes back. Just wondering if anyone else is seeing this too. Edit: 11/6/18 - According to Android Police this issue has been fixed. I can confirm that I am no longer getting the location icon on my Pixel 3 XL while in the Pixel Launcher. amp#x200B; Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to setup my phone with the essential apps I need (maps, email, messaging) and without the time-sucking apps that contribute towards me wasting my life away. I'm motivated in 2019 to take my time back. amp#x200B; I currently use stock Android. In the past I uninstalled Reddit apps and "deactivated" Chrome , Youtube, and the App Store--which worked great for a little while. But I want a setup that's more permanent--with stock Android UPDATE: New thread is up and running! Pics work in mobile app gotta click the name for the pc and mobile browser. Working on solutions ATM. (NEW THREAD): https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSpoofing/comments/9kp42w/android\_pok%C3%A9mon\_go\_spoofing\_works\_for\_nonrooted/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSpoofing/comments/9kp42w/android_pok%C3%A9mon_go_spoofing_works_for_nonrooted/) amp#x200B; THE CURRENT THREAD HAS BEEN UPDATED WITH A BETTER LAYOUT, PICTURES, MORE DETAILS AND FURTHER. I'm having major issues getting the app to verify me. Emailed support and of course they admit there's a bug and give me generic instructions to fix. This addition was talked about months ago, why is there still issues? Absolute waste. IMO, ETN needs to find a better company that can handle this level of work. But.both companies are in England so I don't think Yoti will be getting the boot. Hope to see my coins again in my wallet.close to moving on after being with this for 2 years. My phone is android 8.0 with security patch level, November 2018. My smartphone is unrooted, so the question is. Can I use fake GPS on Pokemon go in my smartphone. </p>
